# The Gren Programming Language

This repo contains the source code of "The Gren Programming Language", available to read from [gren-lang.org](https://gren-lang.org/book/).

## Development

To build the project, you'll need to have `mdbook` installed. This can be done with homebrew or the cargo build system.

To build a new version of the book, execute `mdbook build`. Commiting the changes to master will update the online version.

For local development you can instead use `mdbook serve`, which will display the book on `localhost:3000`.
