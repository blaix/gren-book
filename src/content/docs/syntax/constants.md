You can attach names to values. Named values are called constants, because once defined those names can never refer to another value.

```elm
theAnswer = 42

aQuestion = "What is the answer?"

helpful = False
```

Gren supports several different kinds of constants. These are the primitive types:

* Integers (`Int`): A whole number. Example: `42`.
* Floating point numbers (`Float`): An approximation of a fractional number. Example: `5.2`.
* Characters (`Char`): A single UTF-16 encoded character. Example: `'a'`.
* Strings (`String`): An array of UTF-16 encoded characters. Example: `"test"`.
* Booleans (`Bool`): Either `True` or `False`.
