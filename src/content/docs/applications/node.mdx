title: Node Applications
description: Writing node applications in Gren.
---

Gren has a couple different ways you can write applications that run on nodejs.
We'll go over each one here, starting with simple programs.

First we need to [init a new project](/book/hello_world/).
But this time, we will target the node platform.
In an empty directory, run:

```sh
gren init --platform=node
```

This will create a `gren.json` file configured for node and a `src` directory to hold your source code.

## Simple Program

[Node.defineSimpleProgram](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/browser/latest/module/Browser#sandbox) is good for short-lived programs or scripts.
We'll go over regular programs in a later section.

Below is an example of the classic Hello World program.
It's ok if you don't understand it yet, we will go through it piece by piece in the next sections.

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers
module Main exposing (main)

import Init
import Node exposing (Environment)
import Stream
import Task


main : Node.SimpleProgram a
main =
    Node.defineSimpleProgram init


init : Environment -> Init.Task (Cmd a)
init env =
    "Hello, World!"
        |> Stream.sendLine env.stdout
        |> Task.execute
        |> Node.endWithCmd
```

### Compile

To run the program you need to compile it.
First, save the above code in `src/Main.gren`.
Then compile and run the resulting js file:

```sh
gren make src/Main.gren
node app
```

You should see:

```
Hello, World!
```

In the following sections we'll go over each part of the program to see how it works.

### Module definition

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers
module Main exposing (main)
```

This is our [module declaration](/book/syntax/modules/) and it is exposing our `main` function which has our program definition.

### Imports

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=3
import Init
import Node exposing (Environment)
import Stream
import Task
```

Here we're [importing](/book/syntax/modules/#imports) other modules we will need.
The docs for each of these are helpful if you want to understand more:

* [Init](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/Init)
* [Node](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/Node)
* [Stream](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/Stream)
* [Task](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/latest/module/Task)

### Main function

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=9
main : Node.SimpleProgram a
main =
    Node.defineSimpleProgram init
```

The `main` function is where Gren expects to find your program definition.
Here we're defining a [SimpleProgram](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/Node#SimpleProgram).
All it needs is an init function.

### Init

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=14 {"1":4} {"2":5} {"3":6}
init : Environment -> Init.Task (Cmd a)
init env =
    "Hello, World!"
        |> Stream.sendLine env.stdout
        |> Task.execute
        |> Node.endWithCmd
```

Here is the heart of our program.

1. We start with a string being passed to [`Stream.sendLine`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/Stream#sendLine).
   The first argument to `sendLine` is the stream we want to send it to, in our case that's stdout, which is available in the [`Environment`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/Node#Environment) that's passed in.
   The result of this call is a [task](/book/applications/tasks/) that tells Gren to output our string on that stream.
2. Here we are turning the stream task into a [command](/book/applications/commands/) with [`Task.execute`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/latest/module/Task#execute).
   Commands are how we trigger effects in the [Gren Runtime](/book/applications/runtime/).
3. Finally, we pass that command to [`Node.endWithCmd`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/Node#endWithCmd) to end the program.
   `endWithCmd` is specific to `SimpleProgram`.
   We'll cover other ways to end programs in a later section.

This should be enough to get you started making simple programs.
As always, [reach out](https://gren-lang.org/community) if you need help.
Or read on to learn about creating long-lived programs.

## Let's make a web server!

For more complex or long-running programs, we'll want a full [`Node.Program`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/Node#Program).

Here's an example of using `Node.Program` to create an HTTP server.
As usual, we'll go through it piece by piece in the next sections.

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers
module Main exposing (main)

import HttpServer exposing (Request, Server)
import HttpServer.Response as Response exposing (Response)
import Init
import Node exposing (Environment)
import Stream exposing (Stream)
import Task


main : Node.Program Model Msg
main =
    Node.defineProgram
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        }



type alias Model =
    { server : Maybe Server }


serverConfig =
    { host = "localhost"
    , port_ = 3000
    }


init : Environment -> Init.Task { model : Model, command : Cmd Msg }
init env =
    Init.await HttpServer.initialize <| \serverPermission ->
        Node.startProgram
            { model = { server = Nothing }
            , command =
                HttpServer.createServer serverPermission serverConfig
                    |> Task.attempt GotServer
            }


type Msg
    = GotServer (Result HttpServer.ServerError Server)
    | GotRequest Request Response


update : Msg -> Model -> { model : Model, command : Cmd Msg }
update msg model =
    case msg of
        GotServer result ->
            case result of
                Ok server ->
                    { model = { server = Just server }
                    , command = Cmd.none
                    }

                Err _ ->
                    { model = model
                    , command =
                        Task.execute (Node.exitWithCode 1)
                    }

        GotRequest request response ->
            { model = model
            , command =
                response
                    |> Response.setBody ("You requested: " ++ request.url.path)
                    |> Response.send
            }


subscriptions : Model -> Sub Msg
subscriptions model =
    case model.server of
        Just server ->
            HttpServer.onRequest server GotRequest

        Nothing ->
            Sub.none
```

Save this to `src/Main.gren` and run the program with:

```sh
gren make src/Main.gren
node app
```

You won't see any output, but if you visit any path on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) you will see a page showing the URL you visited.
You can quit the program with `CTRL-c`.

Now let's see what's happening.

### Main

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=11
main : Node.Program Model Msg
main =
    Node.defineProgram
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , subscriptions = subscriptions
        }
```

This time we're using [`defineProgram`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/Node#defineProgram).
This defines programs that can trigger effects (like sending HTTP responses) and subscribe to events (like HTTP requests).
We're defining it using a [record](/book/syntax/records/) that points to our `init`, `update`, and `subscribe` functions.
We'll cover those next.

### Init

First we define our Model:

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=21
type alias Model =
    { server : Maybe Server }
```

Our model will hold our [Server](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/HttpServer#Server).
It's not guaranteed that our server will start (e.g. maybe the port is being used) so we have to hold it in a [Maybe](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/latest/module/Maybe).
`Maybe` is core [custom type](/book/syntax/custom_types/) with two variants: `Just something` where `something` is the value you want, or `Nothing`.

Next, we define a constant to hold our server configuration:

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=25
serverConfig =
    { host = "localhost"
    , port_ = 3000
    }
```

This will make it easier if we want to change the config, or print it when the server starts.

Next is our `init` function that starts the program:

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=31
init : Environment -> Init.Task { model : Model, command : Cmd Msg }
init env =
    Init.await HttpServer.initialize <| \serverPermission ->
        Node.startProgram
            { model = { server = Nothing }
            , command =
                HttpServer.createServer serverPermission serverConfig
                    |> Task.attempt GotServer
            }
```

This is different than the `init` functions we've written so far.
It's wrapped in a call to [`Init.await`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/Init#await).

Node applications have a concept of subsystems and permissions.
Subsystems are things in the world outside of your program (e.g. the filesystem, network requests, the terminal itself).
Functions that interact with them will require a permission value.
You can only get that value via an init task that initializes the subsystem when you start your program.
This means it's impossible for library code to trigger effects without you explicitly giving it permission to do so by passing in the permission value.
You can read more about initializing subsystems in the [Init](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/Init) docs.

In our case, we need to initialize the HTTP server subsystem with [`HttpServer.initialize`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/HttpServer#initialize).
This gives us permission to create the server with [`HttpServer.createServer`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/HttpServer#createServer).
Because starting a server is something that could fail, `createServer` gives us a [Task](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/latest/module/Task) that could result in a Server value, or an error.
We use [`Task.attempt`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/latest/module/Task#attempt) to turn that into a command that we can send to the [Gren Runtime](/book/applications/runtime/) to perform the task.
It takes a message that expects a [Result](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/core/version/latest/module/Result).
`Result` is a core [custom type](/book/syntax/custom_types/) with two variants:
one with the value we want (in our case, a [`Server`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/HttpServer#Server) value if the server started successfully),
and one with an error value (in our case, a [`ServerError`](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/node/version/latest/module/HttpServer#ServerError) if the server failed to start).

We will handle those two scenarios in our `update` function.
