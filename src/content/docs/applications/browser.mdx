## Initialize a project

To create a Gren application that will run in the browser, in an empty directory, run:

```sh
gren init
```

This will create a `gren.json` file and a `src` directory to hold your source code.

## Sandbox Programs

A [sandbox](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/browser/latest/module/Browser#sandbox) is a simplified type of program that can update HTML and react to user interaction, but not much else.
We'll go over the other types of programs in later sections.

Below is an example sandbox program with buttons to increase or decrease a number.
It will look like this:

![Plus and minus buttons with a zero between them](../../../assets/counter.png)

Here's the full program.
It's ok if you don't understand it yet, we will go through it piece by piece in later sections.
For now, save the following in `src/Main.gren`:

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers
module Main exposing (main)

import Browser
import Html exposing (Html)
import Html.Attributes as Attribute
import Html.Events as Event


main =
    Browser.sandbox
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , view = view
        }


type alias Model =
    Int


init : Model
init = 
    0


type Msg
    = Increment
    | Decrement


update : Msg -> Model -> Model
update msg model =
    case msg of
        Increment ->
            model + 1

        Decrement ->
            model - 1


view : Model -> Html Msg
view model = 
    Html.div []
        [ Html.button
            [ Event.onClick Decrement ]
            [ Html.text "-" ]
        , Html.text (String.fromInt model)
        , Html.button
            [ Event.onClick Increment ]
            [ Html.text "+" ]
        ]
```

Now compile and open the resulting html file:

```sh
gren make src/Main.gren
open index.html
```

Try clicking the buttons and you should see the number increase and decrease.
In the following sections we'll go over each part of the program to see how it works.

### Module definition

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers
module Main exposing (main)
```

This is your [module declaration](/book/syntax/modules/) and it is exposing your `main` function.
`main` is where Gren expects to find your program definition, which we'll get to in a bit.

### Imports

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=3
import Browser
import Html exposing (Html)
import Html.Attributes as Attribute
import Html.Events as Event
```

Here we're [importing](/book/syntax/modules/#imports) other modules we will need and creating some helpful aliases for the longer ones.

### Main function

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=3
main =
    Browser.sandbox
        { init = init
        , update = update
        , view = view
        }
```

When you compile an application, Gren expects a `main` function with your program definition.
Here we're defining a [sandbox](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/browser/latest/module/Browser#sandbox) program.

We're defining the program with a [record](/book/syntax/records/) that points to our `init`, `update`, and `view` functions.
These correspond to the components of [the elm architecture](/book/applications/tea/) and we'll describe them next.

### The Model

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=17
type alias Model =
    Int


init : Model
init =
    0
```

Here we're defining a [type alias](/book/syntax/types/#type-aliases) for our Model.

Your model holds your application state and can be anything.
Often you will use a record to hold multiple values, but in our case we only care about the current value of the counter, so we're just aliasing an Int.

The `init` function returns the initial value of the model when the program starts.
In this case, we're starting at zero.

### Update

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=26
type Msg
    = Increment
    | Decrement


update : Msg -> Model -> Model
update msg model =
    case msg of
        Increment ->
            model + 1

        Decrement ->
            model - 1
```

This is the "update" part of [the elm architecture](/book/applications/tea/).
`Msg` is a [custom type](/book/syntax/custom_types/) holding all the events that can happen in the system.
When a user triggers one of those messages from [the view](#view), Gren calls `update` to get a new model and will update the view accordingly.
Here we're [pattern matching](/book/syntax/pattern_matching/) on the message to return a new model that's either incremented or decremented by 1.

### View

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=41
view : Model -> Html Msg
view model =
    Html.div []
        [ Html.button
            [ Event.onClick Decrement ]
            [ Html.text "-" ]
        , Html.text (String.fromInt model)
        , Html.button
            [ Event.onClick Increment ]
            [ Html.text "+" ]
        ]
```

This is the "view" part of [the elm architecture](/book/applications/tea/).
It's a function that, given the current model, returns a UI: a visual representation of your current application state, with triggers to fire messages that can [update](#update) that state.

For browser applications Gren expects the view to return HTML.
Gren's [Html module](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/browser/version/latest/module/Html) has functions for all of the HTML elements.
Most of them take two parameters: an [array](/book/syntax/arrays/) of [attributes](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/browser/version/latest/module/Html.Attributes), and the contents of the element (for many the contents will be another array of elements).

Here we're returning a `div` with three elements:

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=43 {2-4}
    Html.div []
        [ Html.button
            [ Event.onClick Decrement ]
            [ Html.text "-" ]
        , Html.text (String.fromInt model)
        , Html.button
            [ Event.onClick Increment ]
            [ Html.text "+" ]
        ]
```

The first element of our `div` is a [button](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/browser/version/latest/module/Html#button).
The first parameter passed to the button function is an array holding one attribute: an [onClick event](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/browser/version/latest/module/Html.Events#onClick) so when a user clicks the button, our `update` function will be called with our `Decrement` message.
The second parameter is another array for the contents of the button.
In our case that's just some [text](https://packages.gren-lang.org/package/gren-lang/browser/version/latest/module/Html#text) with a minus sign.

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=43 {5}
    Html.div []
        [ Html.button
            [ Event.onClick Decrement ]
            [ Html.text "-" ]
        , Html.text (String.fromInt model)
        , Html.button
            [ Event.onClick Increment ]
            [ Html.text "+" ]
        ]
```

The second element of our `div` is some more text showing the current count.
We get that by converting our model (an Int) to a string.

```elm title="src/Main.gren" showLineNumbers startLineNumber=43 {6-8}
    Html.div []
        [ Html.button
            [ Event.onClick Decrement ]
            [ Html.text "-" ]
        , Html.text (String.fromInt model)
        , Html.button
            [ Event.onClick Increment ]
            [ Html.text "+" ]
        ]
```

The third element of our `div` is another button.
It's similar to the first, but clicking it will send the `Increment` message.

This should be enough to get you started writing browser applications in Gren.
